Our next major release will be 2.0.0.  We are excited to offer some great major improvements.  Some of these improvements coming in v2 are:

* Modular Design - Choose a connector that matches your environment (Jersey 2, Resteasy or HttpClient).  Choose a Logging module that matches your environment (SLF4j, Log4j, JDK, etc) and OpenStack4j will log to it.
* Jackson 1.x has been upgraded to FasterXML Jackson v2
* The default Jersey 2 connector is now at 2.10.1
* Configuration options (timeouts, SSL Context, verifiers, etc)
* And much, much more!
